            The island of Gili Meno, Indonesia
            Nearby Gili Trawangan is a hotspot for backpackers from all over the world, but Gili Meno is an undiscovered paradise firmly off the beaten track. There is no pier, no roads and limited development; this is truly a castaway experience.

            Yaxchilan, Mexico
            This ruined Mayan city on the border of Mexico and Guatemala receives very few visitors compared to other similar areas. It’s amazingly mysterious, shrouded in jungle – ideal for those looking for that ‘Indiana Jones’ moment.

            El Nido Pangulasian Island, Philippines
            This luxury hideaway (known as Island of the Sun) is just off Palawan in the western Philippines. It’s an eco-friendly island with a pristine beach and a backdrop of lush, tropical rainforest. There’s a real focus on nature here with forest hiking and a marine sanctuary on offer.
